## Introduction
Preprocessed data derived from a set of essays (feature selection, normalization, oversampling), then conducted predictive analysis utilizing machine learning models such as SVMs and ensemble classifiers such as Random Forest Classifiers. At the end, the various models' accuracies are evaluated with the help of a confusion matrix and a cohen kappa score.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project was obtained from a [popular Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/asap-aes) sponsored by the Hewlett Foundation.
